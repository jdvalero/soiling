<a name="tradsqlexport">Traditional SQL Export</a>
</h4>
<p class="Body">
Like any other database modelling tool DBDesigner 4 can export the model as a SQL script file
which can be executed by any database maintenance tool, like the MySql command line tool.<br>
<br>
All SQL CREATE TABLE statements and the Standard Inserts can be written to the SQL script file
depending on user settings.<br>
<br>
It is also possible to output all SQL DROP TABLE statements.
</p>
<h4 class="Heading3">
<a name="whatisdbsync">What is Database Synchronisation?</a>
</h4>
<p class="Body">
With DBDesigner 4 you can simplify the task of creating and maintaining your database.
DBDesigner 4 offers the ability to connect to a MySQL server and to create and
synchronize a database with the designed model.<br>
<br>
Synchronisation means that DBDesigner 4 scans all tables in the existing database and checkes
for differences. If a table is present in the model but not in the database, the according
SQL CREATE TABLE statement is executed.<br>
If the table is not present in the model but in the database it can be deleted depending on
user settings.<br>
If the table exists in the model and the database as well, all fields are compared and if there is
a difference, the appropriate SQL ALTER TABLE statements are executed.
</p>
<h4 class="Heading3">
<a name="whatisreverse">What is Reverse Engineering?</a>
</h4>
<p class="Body">
To reverse engineer a database means to connect to a database server, take an existing database
and automatically build a database model based on the meta information in the database.<br>
<br>
Within DBDesigner 4 all table information is extracted from the meta information and relation between
the tables are rendered based on table and field names. The tables are placed on the model in alphabetical order 
following a grid scheme defined by the user.
<br>
The process of reverse engineering is possible with MySQL, Oracle and any database
which is accessable by ODBC.<br>
<br>
The extraction of all table information is only possible using a MySQL database. All other databases are limited
to the bottleneck of ODBC.

<h5 class="Heading4">
Please notice
</h5>
<p class="Body">
To make changes to meta information in a database it is necessary to connect as an user with the required rights.
Within MySQL the database administrator is called root. He has got all rights and is allowed to create a new database 
or make changes to any database. Every other user is allowed to access and modify only the tables he has got the
appropriate rights for.<br>

To avoid problems while synchronizing or quering a database make sure the user which is used to build the connection
to the database has the required rights.
